# LIVE-SIGN-LANGUAGE-INTO-SPEECH-IN-TAMIL
Live Sign Language into Speech in Tamil is an AI-based assistive system that converts hand sign language gestures into real-time Tamil speech using a webcam. It applies computer vision, MediaPipe, and machine learning in Python to recognize gestures and generate spoken Tamil, promoting inclusive communication for hearing-impaired users.

# Live Sign Language into Speech in Tamil

## 📌 Project Overview
Live Sign Language into Speech in Tamil is an assistive AI-based application designed to bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired individuals and the general public. The system converts real-time hand sign language gestures into audible Tamil speech using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

The application captures live video through a webcam, detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe, classifies gestures using a trained machine learning model, and converts the recognized gesture into Tamil text and speech output. This project focuses on regional language accessibility, making it highly useful for Tamil-speaking communities.
